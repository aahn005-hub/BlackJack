# BlackJack

## Introduction
This project involves the game BlackJack. User will be asked for their names and wager. Afterwards, the game will draw two cards for the player and two cards for the dealer. One of the cards on the dealer hands will be hidden and will not be shown until the player decides to stay. The code will prompt the user to Hit, Stay, or Quit. If player decides to hit, they will be given a new card until they decide to stay. All this in mind that if the player exceeds 21, they will BUST and lose their wager. Also, it is noted that the game will continue to show the probability of getting a blackjack from the next hit. Once the player stays, the dealer will show their hidden card and will hit as long as their cards are below 16. Once the dealer stays, the game will decide who wins based off of whoever has the higher value while being under 21. You gain money if you win and lose the money if you lose. If the player and dealer ties, a PUSH occurs and the player will neither win nor lose their wager.
